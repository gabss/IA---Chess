# IAChess
Project for the course of "Artificial Intelligence" at Computer Science in Bologna

This is an implementation of a "limited Chess" with Unity3D.
It's limited because we consider a game with only pawns and king. The game ends when a player promotes.

The IA utilizes an implementation of an iterative AlphaBeta with a limit on time, depending on the choosen difficulty (hard 30s, medium 20s, easy 10s).

You can read the Italian relation for more information about the IA.
