# IAChess
Project for the course of "Artificial Intelligence" at Computer Science in Bologna

This is an implementation of a "limited Chess" with Unity3D.
It's limited because we consider a game with only pawns and king. The game ends when a player promotes.

The IA utilize an implementation of an iterative AlphaBeta with a limit on time, depending on the choosen difficulty (hard 30s, medium 20s, easy 10s).

You can read the relation (in italian, i'm planning to translate in english too) for more information about the IA.
